# Amazon-Clone

Developed a fully responsive clone of the Amazon website, incorporating key elements such as a dynamic navigation bar, search functionality, product showcase, and multi-section layout using HTML,
CSS, and Font Awesome.

Ensured cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness by effectively implementing CSS styling techniques, including flexbox and hover effects, to replicate Amazon's user interface.
